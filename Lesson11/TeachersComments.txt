Well done!

In your solution there's no need in merge, you're doing all the calculation with the unpivot.
Solution is very intresting, I haven't even thought of it :) But the task was still to practise MERGE.
My view of solution:
MERGE INTO res t
USING data_for_merge s ON s.Alex=t.function_name
WHEN MATCHED 
	THEN UPDATE SET function_count=function_count+1
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND Alex IS NOT NULL
	THEN INSERT (function_name, function_count)
	VALUES (Alex, 1);

MERGE INTO res t
USING data_for_merge s ON s.Barbara=t.function_name
WHEN MATCHED 
	THEN UPDATE SET function_count=function_count+1
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND Barbara IS NOT NULL
	THEN INSERT (function_name, function_count)
	VALUES (Carlos, 1);
